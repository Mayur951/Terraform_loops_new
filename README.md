# Terraform_loops_new

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Terraform using JSON files and leveraging multiple for loops.

Overview
JSON files serve as variable inputs for the Virtual Network (VNet) and Network Security Group (NSG) modules.
The encoded JSON files are incorporated into the main.tf files and utilized within their respective modules.
The repository contains two main modules: VNet and NSG, each consisting of multiple files.
These modules are invoked and orchestrated within the main.tf file.
This setup showcases a structured approach to managing infrastructure configurations with Terraform, facilitating scalability and maintainability.
